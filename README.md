# DFS Maze Generator & Solver (C#)

This project is a C# console application that demonstrates the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm through maze generation and maze solving.
The application generates a random maze, visualizes it in the console using Unicode characters, and allows the user to solve the maze step-by-step using DFS.
